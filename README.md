# [@libby_ab_bot](https://t.me/libby_ab_bot) Telegram bot code

This is the code for my Telegram Bot to download Libby Audiobook MP3

# Usage Instruction

This bot can download audiobooks that you have on loan, but you'll need to already have the Libby app set up on your phone/device.

You can begin by granting it access to your Libby library. This bot provides the option to set up Libby on another device.

Don't worry, this will not log you out from your current Libby device.

1. Use `/sync XXXXXXXX` (8 digit Libby setup code)
2. `/list` (to see all your audiobooks in your loan)
3. `/download 2` (the number on the item of your list)
4. Wait a while, and it should give you a link to download the zip file.
